Input format of the instances (each value is white-space separated)

min plan length to try
max plan length to try
nb of actions
action costs flag (0/1/2/3 corresponding to none/same/sum/max to combine automata objectives)
if flag>0
   lower bound on objective to minimize, given by two integers b and c: the bound is b+c*(current plan length)
nb of automata
for each automaton
    nb of local states (numbered consecutively starting from 0)
    initial state id
    nb of goal states
    for each goal state
    	goal state id
    nb of local actions (numbered consecutively starting from 0)
    for each (original) action (map it to a local action)
    	id of corresponding local action
    for each local state s
    	for each local action o
	    id of state to which we transition from s on o (any negative value indicates no transition)
    local action costs flag (1 if local actions have different costs; 0 otherwise)
    if flag=1
       for each local action
       	   its integer cost
